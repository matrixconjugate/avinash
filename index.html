        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Better Ed Co</h3>
        <p><strong>Product</strong><br>May 2022 - Present (2 years 1 month)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leading product work @ cooking.app to help you become confident home cook.</li>
            <li>Led analytics across all projects in the org.</li>
            <li>Tinkering and embedding LLMs in product workflows.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cuemath</h3>
        <p><strong>Associate Product Manager</strong><br>Apr 2021 - Apr 2022 (1 year 1 month)<br>Bengaluru, Karnataka, India</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Productized an alternate sales strategy as a quick experiment for US/International market.</li>
            <li>Improved 'on platform' trial class request to teacher slot matching from 75% to 88% and to 94% 'off platform' using rigorous data analytics. Key insight was that different trial class requests came with different but predictable patterns.</li>
            <li>Improved feedback and input response rate from roughly 25% (via whatsapp, max reach ~50 teachers) to 65% (on platform, max reach - all active teachers).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Texas Instruments</h3>
        <p><strong>Digital Design Engineer</strong><br>Oct 2020 - Apr 2021 (7 months)<br>Bengaluru, Karnataka, India</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Short stint long enough to realize that I can't live with 0.0001% of the impact pie. I needed more, so jumped quickly into startup space. Another simple reason this didn't make sense was that I could do complex Fourier transforms but struggled putting a resistor and a capacitor together with a voltage source.</li>
            <li>Learnt a bunch of tools and bash commands. Almost deleted the "desktop" app off a virtual machine, never knew that it was possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Intellify</h3>
        <p><strong>Founding Team</strong><br>Jan 2018 - May 2020 (2 years 5 months)<br>New Delhi Area, India</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Love for teaching led me to getting involved in this project brewing up at IIT Delhi. Got a first-hand experience of how projects transform in organisations and how to problem solve at scale. Picked up a bit of everything - product, events, content, operations.</li>
            <li>Highlights: conducting social entrepreneurship workshops in schools across Delhi, organising a 6 day design bootcamp for kids at IITD campus, and conducting a nationwide olympiad.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Texas Instruments</h3>
        <p><strong>Digital Design Intern</strong><br>May 2019 - Jul 2019 (3 months)<br>Bengaluru, Karnataka, India</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python, TCL based automation of power analysis tools for semiconductor chips. Analyzed over 1M+ data points across various PVT values.</li>
